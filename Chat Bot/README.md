# Chat Bot.

Here I created my own chat bot utilizing *random* data from Wikipedia.

* Firstly What exactly is a chatbot?
  A chatbot, often known as a bot, is a computer software that mimics normal human conversation.

# The project's architecture.
  Basically, the NLP model interacts with the chat window or terminal.
  A natural language processing (NLP) model requires data or a corpus from which it can be trained.
  The NLP model generates and reverts the answer based on this data. The response appears in the Chat window or Terminal.


# Steps: 
  1. Import Corpus.
  2. Pre Process the data.
  3. Text case handling.
  4. Tokenization.
  5. Stemming.
  6. Bag Of Words (Bog)/ TF-IDF.
  7. One Hot Encoding.


# Note/Improvement: This is a fun project that I recently completed.
# The use of correct corpus can improve the model.
