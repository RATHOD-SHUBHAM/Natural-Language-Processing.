# SpamDetection Using Natural Language Processing

Natural language processing (NLP) is a subfield of artificial intelligence and is concerned with the interactions between computers and human (natural) languages,in particular how to program computers to process and analyze large amounts of natural language data.


## Cleaning up the text data is necessary to highlight attributes that you're going to want your machine learning system to pick up on.

Cleaning (or pre-processing) the data typically consists of a number of steps:

#### 1. Remove punctuation
#### 2. Tokenization
#### 3. Remove stopwords
#### 4. Lemmatize/Stem


# Spam Detection

#### step 1 : Read the file content into data variable and give it a heading.

#### step 2 : Remove punctuation, tokenize, stopword and stem.

#### step 3 : Perform count vectorization.

#### step 4 : Splitting the dataset.
